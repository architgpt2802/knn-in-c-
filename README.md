#KNN ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION IN C++
**K Nearest Neighbours** is a machine learning algorithm that stores all the available cases and classifies the new data or case based on the similarity measure. It suggests that if you are similar to your neighbour then you are one of them.
Ex: if mango looks more similar to apple, orange, banana than it is to monkey, elephant, dog; then most likely mango belongs to the group of fruits.
KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. However, it is most widely used in the classification prediction problems.

##HOW DOES KNN WORK
Letâ€™s take a simple case to understand this algorithm. Following is the spread of red circles and green squares:
